## Problem Statement

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis using Python and creating a COVID-19 dashboard in Power BI. The focus is on understanding the impact of Covid-19 in India, including vaccination status, and generating visualizations of global Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries using Power BI.

COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python and Power BI
Objective: Analyze the impact of COVID-19 globally and in India using Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning to extract actionable insights.

Data Collection: Obtain datasets from reliable sources such as WHO, COVID-19 API, or Kaggle, containing information on cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccinations.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values using imputation techniques (mean, median, or predictive models).
Remove duplicate entries and ensure dataset consistency.
Parse date fields and standardize formats for time-series analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths over time.
Identify patterns and hotspots for infection rates using geospatial visualizations.
Compare vaccination rates among different regions and demographic factors.
Data Visualization:

Generate heatmaps showing the distribution of COVID-19 cases across states or countries.
Create histograms and boxplots to compare infection and recovery rates across regions.

Data Normalization:

Scale numeric features (e.g., population, case rates) using Min-Max Scaling or StandardScaler.
Normalize time-series data to address discrepancies across different regions.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features like infection rate, recovery rate, case fatality ratio, and vaccination efficacy.

Segment data into time intervals for granular analysis (e.g., weekly, monthly trends).
Machine Learning Applications:

Clustering: Apply K-Means or DBSCAN to group regions based on case densities and vaccination coverage.
Regression: Predict future trends in cases and deaths using Linear Regression or ARIMA models.
Classification: Use Decision Trees or Random Forests to classify regions into high-risk and low-risk categories based on healthcare resources and COVID-19 statistics.
Python Libraries:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models.
Statsmodels for time-series forecasting and statistical analysis.
Insights:

Identify vaccination trends and their correlation with recovery rates.
Highlight regions with poor vaccination drives and high infection rates.
Analyze the relationships between socio-economic factors and case counts.
Challenges:

Handling inconsistent or incomplete data from various sources.
Updating datasets to ensure the analysis reflects the latest COVID-19 statistics.
Deliverables:

Python scripts for preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
Visualized results of global and Indian COVID-19 trends, including heatmaps, time-series plots, and bar charts.
A detailed summary of findings and actionable insights.
